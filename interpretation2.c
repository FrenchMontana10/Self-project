INTERPRETATION OF PROJECT 4.
We included our stdio.h header file in the first line of our project. 
A variable TOTAL_SIZE was initialized to 20. After that, we had our int main function and we started writing our code.
We declared an array variable data[TOTAL_SIZE] of type integer.
We went ahead to declare and initialize a variable called total to 0, i, j, and product. We also declared a variable avg of type float.
We started a for loop and initialized i to 0. Then we gave a condition that i should be less than the variable TOTAL_SIZE. We also stated that i should update itself with one anytime we're done running our project.
We then opened our code block and initialized the variable product to i * TOTAT_SIZE. This means that the sum of i * TOTAL_SIZE should be the value for product.
We initialized data[i] = product. And the variable total was also initialized to the sum of total and product. Then we ended our for loop.
After our for loop, we initialized the variable avg to the result of total and TOTAL_SIZE.
Then we printed the results of average in the next line of code.
We started another for loop and initialized the variable j to TOTAL_SIZE and gave it the condition that j should be more than 0. We also stated that j should update itself by reducing itself by one after we ran our code everytime.
We opened our code block and printed the values of j and array data[j] and then we ended our code.
We returned 0 and ended our entire code.
