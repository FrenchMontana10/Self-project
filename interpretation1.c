INTERPRETATION OF QUESTION 3.
An variable called SIZE of type const unsigned int was declared and initialized to 20.
An array of type integer n[SIZE] was also declared in the next line of code.
Integer variables namely position and index were also declared.
We started a for loop and initialized position to zero. We gave a condition that position should be less than anything that the variable SIZE contains which is 20. And we said that position should always update itself by 1 everytime condition our condition is true.
So in the code block of the for loop, we said declared and initialized the array n[position] to position + 4.
We then broke out of our for loop.
We started another for loop and initialized index to 0. We gave a condition that index should be less than anything that the variable SIZE contains which is 20.
And we also gave a condition that index should always update itselfby 1 everytime our condition is true.
So the computer ran our program and printed out the values of elements until the condition was false.
