OVERVIEW OF FIRST PROJECT.

I included the stdio.h header file so that I can use the printf function.
I included my main function.
I opened my square braces.
I declared and initialized an array variable numbers of type integer on a single line.
After that,I printed out each of the elements of the arrays using their indexes in order to address them.
I ended my code by returning 0 and closing my code with a square brace.
I was able to ran and compile without errors and they gave me the right results.


OVERVIEW OF SECOND PROJECT.

I began this code by including my stdio.h header file so that I could use the printf function.
I included my main function as well.
I opened my square braces and started my code.
I declared an array variable salaries of type of float on one line.
I went ahead to initialize each of the array elements in the subsequent line of code.
After that, I printed every one of the salaries using their indexes.
I ended my code by returning 0 and closing my code with a square brace.
I ran and compiled my code without any errors.
The results of my code was the correct one.
